Find the height of a binary tree which is the number of edges 
between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. 
This means that a tree containing a single node has a height zero.

Method:
public int getTreeHeight(TreeNode node)

TreeNode class:
public class TreeNode {
	int val;
	TreeNode left;
	TreeNode right;

	TreeNode(int x) {
		val = x;
	}
}
