There is a new alien language which uses the Latin alphabet. But, 
the order among letters are unknown. A list of non-empty words 
from the dictionary is given. The words in the dictionary are 
sorted lexicographically by the rules of this language.
Derive the order of letters in this language. If the order is 
invalid, return empty list.

Example 1:
Input: ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
Output: ['w', 'e', 'r', 't', 'f']

Example 2:
Input: ["z", "x"]
Output: ['z', 'x']

Example 3:
Input: ["z", "x", "z"]
Output: []


Method:
public List<Character> getOrders(String[] words)
