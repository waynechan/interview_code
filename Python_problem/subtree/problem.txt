You have two binary trees: x and y. check if y is a subtree of x.

Example 1:
y is a subtree of x

       1                3
      / \              / 
 x = 2   3       y =  4
        /
       4

Example 2:
y is not a subtree of x

       1               3
      / \               \
 x = 2   3        y =    4
        /
       4
